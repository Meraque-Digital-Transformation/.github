## 🚀 Getting Started – For Team Members

### ✅ Step 1: Upload Your Code
- Create or clone a repository for your project.
- Push your **team-related code** to the respective repository under this organization.

### ✅ Step 2: Set Up Branches
- `main` → stable, tested, and production-ready code only.
- `feature/<feature-name>` → for developing new features.
- `demo/<demo-name>` → for specific demo versions.
- `hotfix/<issue>` → for quick fixes to production code.

> Avoid pushing directly to `main`. Always use pull requests.

## 📄 Licensing

Each repository **must include a `LICENSE.txt` file** with the [Meraque Proprietary License](./LICENSE.txt) to ensure that the intellectual property remains under company ownership.

---

## 🔁 Version Control Best Practices

- ✅ Use **clear, concise commit messages** (e.g., `feat: add obstacle avoidance node`, `fix: resolve null GPS reading`)
- ✅ Open a **pull request** for all changes to be merged into `main`
- ✅ **Tag your reviewers** in the PR so that others can provide feedback or approvals
- ✅ Use **GitHub Issues** to track bugs and tasks
- ✅ Keep the commit history clean (use rebase when necessary)
